# 2. Hubs are fixed infrastructure - cannot be added after initialization

# 5. While moving, truck destination is LOCKED - no mid-route changes
# 6. Local decisions per truck - no global replanning

# DEMAND PRESSURE MODEL:
# - Urgency influences priority but does not force immediate response
# - Changes propagate at next safe decision point
# - Emergency increases urgency weight but does not override stability
